Election Audit Summary:
The python script uploaded to github can be repurposed for other election analysis projects as the logic will remain the same for determining the election vote count per candidate, county and winner of popular vote. Changes will however need to be made to the (file_to_load) as a different dataset will be analyzed. Another change that would also be made is to the dictionaries as they are no longer relevant to the current dataset<img width="419" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-17 at 10 45 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80330988/179403705-f7cf5df2-be3f-4c73-8790-04819178420f.png">
